INTRODUCTION 
---------------------
	The maze solver program takes in a text file that contains a maze inside. The program will 
then attempt to solve the maze by cycling through each part of the maze to find the optimal route. 


INSTALLATION
---------------------

* Download the tar file, "pa2.tar" from sakai
* Once downloaded proceed to the terminal and enter the following command
	tar -xvf pa2.tar
* The file should contain the following:

	- mazesolver.c (the program)
	- maze01.txt
	- maze02.txt
	- maze03.txt
	- maze04.txt
	- maze05.txt
	- maze06.txt
	- README.txt (Readme file)
	- maze.pdf (The instructions for the hw)
	
* After this conduct your test


Usage
---------------------
1. Type "gcc mazesolver.c" in the terminal to compile
2. Once compiled enter "./a.out" in the terminal to run
3. You will be prompted to enter a maze file. (Make sure the maze file has the correct path or else it will not open.
4. The program will solver the maze.

Trouble Shooting
---------------------

	The program does not back track properly but solves the maze completely.


	If the program does not contain all the files, does not compile, or not perform 
as expected, feel free to take points off!


FAQ
---------------------

* How hard was it to code this program?
	The concept is easy to grasp in my head but coding it proved to be a challenge.
Although the maze solving algorithm is easy to understand for some reason I was unable
to implement it correctly.

* How long did it take you to complete?
	It took me forever to finish. The reading and storing the maze was
not hard at all, it was the maze algorithm that caused problems within the 
program.
