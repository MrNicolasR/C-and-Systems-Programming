INTRODUCTION 
---------------------

	The log times program, is a program that takes in a text file, logtimes.txt
which is a text file that contains multiple times in the format hh:mm. The 
program reads these times and displays the sum of all, the average time and 
the longest time.



INSTALLATION
---------------------

* Download the tar file, "pa1.tar" from sakai
* Once downloaded proceed to the terminal and enter the following command
	tar -xvf pa1.tar
* The file should contain the following:
	- logtimes.c (the program)
	- README.txt (Readme file)
	- logbook.pdf (The instructions for the hw)
	
* After this conduct your test


Trouble Shooting
---------------------

	Although the program has been tested throughly a common problem that may cause
an error is not having the logtimes.txt in the same directory as the program.
To fix this problem, make sure when you un-tar the "pa1" file all the contents
are in the same directory.
	If the program does not contain all the files, does not compile, or not perform 
as expected, feel free to take points off!


FAQ
---------------------

* How hard was it to code this program?
	Not hard at all once I knew how/why I wanted to implement the code

* How long did it take you to complete?
	It took me about 6 hours to complete, most of that time was learning 
how to program in C. After that it was pretty straight forward.
